# PowerShell Core modules for Hub

With PowerShell, it is easier than ever to perform and automate routine Black Duck Hub tasks and generate custom reports not provided by the web interface.

```

# Building

```
Copy-Item -Recurse ./publish "$(($env:PSModulePath -split ';')[0])/BlackDuck.Hub" 
```

# Publishing to PSGallery

1. Increment the version number in BlackDuck.Hub.psd1

# Examples

Show all component versions in the BOM of project 'madplay1'
```
Get-HubProject -name madplay | Get-HubProjectVersion | Get-HubComponentVersion 
```

Show all component versions in the BOM of project 'madplay1' with high risks.
```
Get-HubProject -name madplay | Get-HubProjectVersion | Get-HubComponentVersion | ? {$_.LicenseRiskProfile.High -gt 0 }     
```

Generate a license notification file for a project
```
# First, we get all the component versions as above
$allComponents = Get-HubProject -name madplay  | Get-HubProjectVersion | Get-HubComponentVersion

# Then, we get all the licenses fields of all the versions (these don't contain license texts),
# and expand any conjunctive or disjunctive licenses (unwrap) into their constituent parts
$unwrappedLicenses = $allComponents | select -ExpandProperty Licenses | Unwrap-HubLicense 

# Remove duplicate licenses and get license texts from the Hub
$licenseTexts = $unwrappedLicenses | select -Unique | Get-HubLicenseText

# Finally, combine the license texts into a single string and write them to a file
$separator = "`n`n==============================================================`n`n"
[string]::Join($separator, $licenseTexts) | Out-File /var/tmp/licenses.txt 
```

Get all the project versions affected by vulnerability notifications.
```
Get-HubNotifications | ? Type -eq 'Vulnerability' | select -Expand AffectedProjectVersions | Get-HubProjectVersion
```
